#Classification algorithms in Python
I used the Abalone dataset (from the UCI Machine Learning Repository) to classify the gender of abalones using a decision tree and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in Python. I did this using the Python packages numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and sklearn. Through parameter tuning and by computing accuracy, precision and recall to evaluate the performance of each algorithm, I identified the most performant algorithm- and parameter- combination to classify the respective genders of abalones.
